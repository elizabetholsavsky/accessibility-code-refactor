## Description
This webpage was created as part of a UT Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp challenge. I modified starter code to improve readability, search engine optimization, and accessibility for people using assistive technologies.

## Usage
Click a link in the navigation bar to go to the corresponding content. Use assistive technology to hear image descriptions. You can also use DevTools console to locate image descriptions by pressing Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (MacOS). Inspect element by pressing Control+Shift+C (windows) or Command+Shift+C (MacOS) and click on desired image to view the image description.
